# Intro

Burn My Wallet is a "killswitch" for a stolen wallet.

It creates a non transferable (soul bound) token as a way of marking a wallet as hacked that the hacker cannot remove.

We then provide APIs so other dApps can easily check if a wallet has been hacked.

The goal is to be THE one source of reporting your wallet, making it possible for all connected dApps to properly handle the hacked wallet -- DAOs can cancel voting rights, web3 wallets can prevent payments from being sent to the burnt wallet, social networks can show the account is hacked to prevent impersonation, and smart contracts can prevent interactions with this wallet.

To burn your wallet go to [burnmywallet.com](https://burnmywallet.com)
