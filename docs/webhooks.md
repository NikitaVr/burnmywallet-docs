# Webhooks

Webhooks will be added soon so your code can receive a notification as soon as a Wallet is Burned.

## Burn Submitted

This hook will be sent as soon as the user signs the message to burn their wallet, so you don't need to wait on Block Confirmation.

## Burn Confirmed

This hook will be sent once the transaction is included in a block in the case that you want to wait to make sure the transaction has been confirmed On Chain
